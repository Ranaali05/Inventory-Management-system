# Inventory-management-system
I have made an inventory management system using C# in Windows Forms app (Visual Studio) and MySQL. It is complete and DB connected
To run a C# Windows Forms application from GitHub repository in Visual Studio, you can follow these steps:

Clone Your GitHub Repository:

Open Visual Studio.
Go to "View" > "Team Explorer" to open the Team Explorer panel.
Click on the "Clone" button and enter the URL of your public GitHub repository.
Follow the prompts to clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Project:

In Visual Studio, go to "File" > "Open" > "Project/Solution."
Browse to the folder where you cloned your GitHub repository and select the .sln (solution) file of your Windows Forms application project. Click "Open."
Build the Project:

Before running your application, it's a good practice to build it to ensure that there are no build errors. You can do this by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" from the menu.
Set the Startup Form (if necessary):

In the Solution Explorer, right-click the form you want to start with and select "Set as Startup Form." This step is only necessary if your project contains multiple forms.
Run Your Windows Forms Application:

You can run your application by pressing the "Start" button (a green triangle) in the toolbar, pressing F5, or selecting "Debug" > "Start Debugging" from the menu. This will start your application in debug mode, allowing you to set breakpoints and step through your code.
Debug and Test:

While running your application, you can set breakpoints in your code by clicking in the margin next to the line number. This allows you to inspect variables and step through your code to identify and fix issues.
Stop Debugging:

To stop debugging, press the "Stop" button (a red square) in the toolbar or select "Debug" > "Stop Debugging" from the menu.
Build and Distribute:

Once you're satisfied with your Windows Forms application, you can build a release version by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" again. This will generate an executable file (.exe) in the project's bin\Release directory. You can distribute this file to others.
Publish (Optional):

If you want to create an installer or publish your application, you can use Visual Studio's publishing features. Select "Build" > "Publish [YourProjectName]" and follow the prompts to configure deployment options.
